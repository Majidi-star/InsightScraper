They suggest developing multiple benchmarks for evaluating AI fairness, including descriptive and normative benchmarks. The descriptive benchmarks would assess the AI model's performance on specific tasks or datasets, while the normative benchmarks would evaluate its adherence to certain social norms or values.<br><br>The article mentions that existing fairness benchmarks are limited and may not be sufficient to address bias in AI models. The researchers argue that we need to move beyond one-size-fits-all definitions of fairness and develop more nuanced approaches that take into account the specific context and goals of each application.<br><br>Therefore, the correct answer is that the researchers propose developing multiple benchmarks for evaluating AI fairness, including descriptive and normative benchmarks.  <!-- Replace line breaks with <br> -->
